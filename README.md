## Summary
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia globally, with hippocampal atrophy recognized as an early hallmark. However, the cellular and molecular alterations in the hippocampus throughout disease progression remain elusive. In this study, we employed single-cell multi-omic sequencing techniques, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC sequencing (snATAC-seq), to map transcriptome and chromatin accessibility landscapes in hippocampus of AD and healthy donors, respectively. We established regulatory maps across diverse cell types, identified cell-type-specific features, and inferred regulatory factors, co-regulatory modules, and the associations between open chromatin regions and target genes in the context of AD. Additionally, we constructed regulatory networks for microglia and astrocytes, identifying several disease-related transcription factors, such as SPI1, ATF3, and NFE2L2. By comparing data between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of AD patients, we identified 276 genes that exhibited consistent AD-related changes in both brain regions. We also identified region-specific AD-related genes, revealing that immune-related genes displayed opposite expression patterns between the two regions. This finding highlights the dynamic differences in gene regulation between distinct brain regions and cell types during disease progression. Furthermore, the study uncovered significant differences in AD-associated gene regulation between human and mouse models. There was a notably higher proportion of AD-associated genes in human compared to mouse, underscoring the complexity of AD pathology and presenting challenges for cross-species translational research.
